About Dataset
The Dataset "AI Global index" includes The Global AI Index itself and seven indicators affecting the Index on 62 countries, as well as general information about the countries (region, cluster, income group and political regime).
The Global AI Index말s the first index to benchmark nations on their level of investment, innovation and implementation of artificial intelligence.
Talent, Infrastructure and Operating Environment are the factors of AIImplementation많roup of indicators, which represents the application of artificial intelligence by professionals in various sectors, such as businesses, governments, and communities.
* Talent말ndicator focuses on the availability of skilled practitioners for the provision of artificial intelligence solutions.
* Infrastructure말ndicator focuses on the reliability and scale of access infrastructure, from electricity and internet, to super computing capabilities.
* Operating Environment말ndicator focuses on the regulatory context, and public opinion surrounding artificial intelligence.
Research and Development are the factors ofInnovation많roup of indicators, which reflects the progress made in technology and methodology, which signify the potential for artificial intelligence to evolve and improve.
* Research말ndicator focuses on the extent of specialist research and researchers; investigating the amount of publications and citations in credible academic journals.
* Development말ndicator focuses on the development of fundamental platforms and algorithms upon which innovative artificial intelligence projects rely.
Government Strategy and Commercial are the factors ofInvestment많roup of indicators, which reflects financial and procedural commitments to artificial intelligence.
* Government Strategy말ndicator focuses on the depth of commitment from national government to artificial intelligence; investigating spending commitments and national strategies.
* Commercial말ndicator focuses on the level of startup activity, investment and business initiatives based on artificial intelligence.
All these seven indicators were calculated byTortoise Media맜ia weighting and summarizing 143 other indicators.
The dataset can be used for practicing data cleaning, data visualization, finding correlations between the indexes, Machine Learning (classification, regression, clustering).
